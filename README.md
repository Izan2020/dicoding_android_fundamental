## What's this Repository about?

This project is a starting point for my Android Application.

The repository for an application project that I've meticulously crafted as part of the Dicoding Android Fundamental Course submission has become the cornerstone of data management and organization within the app. Throughout this exciting journey of learning and coding, I've come to appreciate the significance of implementing a well-structured repository pattern in my Android project, as it has unlocked a plethora of benefits and streamlined the development process.
